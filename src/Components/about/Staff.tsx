        Founder and Executive Director of Stomp the World, has been a classroom
        teacher for 18+ years. During his career, he has seen the need and
        desire children have to learn about the numerous opportunities our world

        opportunity to offer Saint Louis area youth experiences outside of the
        classroom. Mark is grateful to all of the great people who volunteer
        their time to make Stomp the World a reality and help us to continue

      with the opportunities to travel with great friends and gain new
      adventures with each trip. This is a privilege that I have treasured
      greatly for it has exposed me to new experiences that I might not have had
      on my own and lets me look forward to being able to do the same with my

      being a part of an organization that encourages and helps the youth
      broaden their horizons with new experiences beyond their backyards.
